This app is created to simulate classic Conway's game of Life. It has two modes: Hexagonal and Square.

You can set rules of birth (B) and survival (S), number of generations and number of shapes by X and Y axes all without changing code.

However, if you are capable of writing Java and understending others code (!!!), you can change it for your own requirements.)
